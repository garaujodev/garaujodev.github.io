### About me

A Software Developer passionate about coding and problem solving in general. Currently, Software Developer at [SourceLevel](https://sourcelevel.io)

I like to deal with different kinds of technologies, always applying my skills and learning new ones. I love to learn about databases and Ops.

I'm learning about Functional Programming and Elixir, that's really impressing me.

If you want to discuss something, or just drink a coffee, feel free to send me a message.
