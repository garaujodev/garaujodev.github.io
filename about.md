### About me

I'm Gustavo Araujo, a software engineer passionate about building efficient and scalable software solutions. Living in Brazil, with over a decade of professional experience, most of that in remote teams. I’ve worked across various industries, from payments and developer tools to mobility and SaaS platforms, always striving to deliver high-quality, high-performance systems.

Currently, I’m a Senior Software Engineer at CloudWalk, where I contribute to the development of InfinitePay, a leading payment solution in Brazil. My focus is on designing and optimizing systems for scalability and reliability, particularly around onboarding new clients and handling millions of daily transactions. I’m dedicated to ensuring code quality, mentoring developers, and fostering a collaborative team environment.

I’m also an active participant in software development communities and events, where I’ve had the opportunity to share knowledge and present talks. I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, which allows me to collaborate with developers worldwide and give back to the community that inspires me daily. Engaging with the community and open source fuels my growth and helps me stay at the forefront of industry trends.
