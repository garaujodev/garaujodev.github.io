### About me

I’m Gustavo Araujo, a software engineer focused on building scalable, reliable, and high-performance systems. I’ve been coding professionally for over a decade, mostly on remote teams, and have worked across industries such as payments, developer tools, mobility, and SaaS.

I love tackling complex technical challenges, especially around distributed systems, system reliability, and high-throughput platforms. My experience includes scaling critical backend services, designing resilient architectures, improving code quality, and mentoring engineering teams.

I care deeply about clean code, strong engineering practices, and creating environments where developers can do their best work. I’m active in the tech community, sharing knowledge through talks, open-source contributions, and technical content.

Always learning, always building.
